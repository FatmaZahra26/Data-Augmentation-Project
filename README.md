# TunAugmentor 🖼️

TunAugmentor is a Python library that provides a set of image augmentation techniques implemented using only Python and Numpy. Our aim with this project was to learn how to implement these techniques, rather than to reinvent the wheel. 🎓

While there are already many libraries available with better implementations of these techniques, we hope that TunAugmentor can serve as a useful learning resource for others interested in image augmentation. 🤓

## Implemented Techniques 🛠️

The library includes implementations of several common image augmentation techniques, including:

- AddGaussianNoise 🎨
- ChangeBrightness ☀️
- ColorModification 🌈
- Crop 🪦
- Flip 🔁
- Flip Horizontal ↔️
- Flip Vertical ↕️
- RandomCrop 🌾
- Rotate 🔄
- Translation 🚶
- TranslationX 🚶‍♂️
- TranslationY 🚶‍♀️
- Zoom 🔍

We were inspired by Albumentations when deciding which transformations to implement and for guidance on documentation. We did not conduct any benchmarking for this library. 🧪

We encourage users to explore Albumentations and other existing libraries for more robust and optimized implementations of image augmentation techniques. 🚀
